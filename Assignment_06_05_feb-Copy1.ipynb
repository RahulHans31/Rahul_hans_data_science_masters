    "\n",
    "    Encapsulation: binding data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It hides the internal details and implementation of an object from the outside world and provides access to the object's behavior through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes. It enables code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. A derived class (child class) can inherit the attributes and methods of a base class (parent class) and can also add its own unique characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables methods to be defined in the superclass and overridden in the subclasses, allowing different implementations based on the specific objects being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction: Abstraction involves the concept of simplifying complex systems by providing only essential details and hiding unnecessary complexity. It allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define the common behavior and attributes for a group of related objects. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and building modular, reusable code.\n"
