    "Exception are the event in the program in which the error occur due the to file not found error , divide by Zero error etc (i.e Syntax is correct but some issue is still there) while Syntax errors are the gramtical made by the developer while writing the code\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation occurs, an exception object is created, and the program flow is transferred to an appropriate exception handler that can handle or respond to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions in Python can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, network errors, division by zero, and more. Python provides a mechanism to handle these exceptions through the use of try-except blocks. By handling exceptions, you can gracefully recover from errors, take alternative actions, or display appropriate error messages to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are different from exceptions. Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters invalid code that violates the language's syntax rules. These errors prevent the interpreter from parsing and executing the code. They are usually caused by typos, missing or misplaced punctuation, incorrect indentation, or using incorrect language constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cause: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when an exceptional condition arises, such as invalid input or unexpected situations. Syntax errors occur during the parsing phase before the execution of the program when the code structure violates the syntax rules of the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks. You can write code to catch specific exceptions and perform appropriate actions to handle them. Syntax errors cannot be handled through try-except blocks because they prevent the code from being parsed and executed. Syntax errors must be fixed by correcting the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Impact on program execution: Exceptions, when unhandled, can cause the program to terminate abruptly or behave unexpectedly. By handling exceptions, you can control the program flow and provide appropriate error handling. Syntax errors, on the other hand, prevent the program from running altogether until the errors are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Error messages: Exceptions provide detailed error messages that describe the cause and type of exception that occurred. These messages can help with debugging and identifying the root cause of the issue. Syntax errors, on the other hand, usually provide specific error messages that indicate the line number and nature of the syntax error, helping developers locate and fix the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are events that occur during program execution, disrupting the normal flow and requiring handling. Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors in the code structure that prevent the program from running altogether until the errors are fixed."
